## Overview
Aurora Threads is a premium fashion boutique renowned for its curated selection of designer clothing, footwear, and accessories. 
Celebrated for its distinctive collections and tailored shopping experience, the brand focuses on staying ahead in the competitive retail landscape by embracing data-driven strategies. 
With multiple locations across various cities, Aurora Threads serves a clientele that values style, quality, and sophistication.

## Business Problem
The boutique is struggling to extract meaningful insights from its expanding data volume. It faces challenges in spotting trends across various product categories and in effectively tracking performance. 
The absence of advanced analytics tools limits the ability to make timely, data-driven business decisions.

## Methodology
I acquired the raw dataset on Excel, cleaned it, then extracted, transformed, and loaded the data on Power BI (using M language in Power Query and DAX functions) for advanced analysis and interactive dashboard visualization. 
I uncovered trends that could fuel better business decisions for the company.

  ## Dashboard

 ## Highlights
 - ✅ Accessories drove the highest revenue— Handbags, Sunglasses, and Wallets
 - ✅ Female customers dominated in sales and volume
 - ✅ Online payments were strongly tied to high-value transactions
 - ✅ Minor discounts had minimal influence on revenue impact
 - ✅ "Regular Spenders" were consistent, but “High Spenders” were gold mines.

 ## 📈 Insight That Matters:
 Clothing may have moved fast, but the real money was in Accessories. 
Recognizing these high-performing segments helps to prioritize resources effectively.


## 💡 Actionable Recommendations:
- 🔹Double down on premium Accessories marketing, possibly with bundled offers
- 🔹Launch targeted loyalty rewards for High-Spenders
- 🔹Encourage online transactions with value-added incentives
- 🔹Monitor store-level performance to drive location-specific strategies, e.g., elevating the experience in stores that attract big spenders.
